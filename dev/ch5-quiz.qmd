Below are **10 auto-graded questions** you can paste into your lab `.qmd` (or Quarto HTML page). They’re written in a **Quarto quiz / assessment style** that auto-checks **multiple choice, multiple-select, and short-answer** responses.

I’m assuming students have already run:

```r
library(coursekata)
flappyBird <- data.frame(...)
```

and that you’re using the outcome **`Hi3Score`** and predictors **`Section`** and **`HiEndScore`**.

> Note: Auto-graded questions work best in **HTML output**. If you’re keeping this as a Jupyter notebook, you can still include these in a Quarto-rendered lab page (HTML) that accompanies the notebook.

## Lab Check: Empty Model for Flappy Bird Scores

### Question 1 (Distribution)
Which type of graph is most appropriate for viewing the distribution of `Hi3Score`?

- [x] Histogram  
- [ ] Scatterplot  
- [ ] Bar chart of categories  
- [ ] Line graph  

:::{.solution}
`Hi3Score` is quantitative, so a histogram is appropriate for its distribution.
:::

---

### Question 2 (Interpretation)
A histogram of `Hi3Score` shows a few very large scores (like 87 and 101). What does this suggest about the distribution?

- [ ] It is symmetric  
- [x] It is right-skewed  
- [ ] It is left-skewed  
- [ ] It is uniform  

:::{.solution}
A few very high values create a long right tail → right-skewed.
:::

---

### Question 3 (Empty model prediction)
For the empty model predicting `Hi3Score`, what value is predicted for **every** student?

- [ ] The median of `Hi3Score`  
- [x] The mean of `Hi3Score`  
- [ ] The maximum of `Hi3Score`  
- [ ] 0  

:::{.solution}
For quantitative outcomes, the empty model predicts the sample mean for everyone.
:::

---

### Question 4 (Fit the empty model)
Which R command correctly fits the empty model for `Hi3Score`?

- [x] `lm(Hi3Score ~ 1, data = flappyBird)`  
- [ ] `lm(Hi3Score ~ Section, data = flappyBird)`  
- [ ] `lm(Hi3Score ~ HiEndScore, data = flappyBird)`  
- [ ] `gf_histogram(~Hi3Score, data = flappyBird)`  

:::{.solution}
The empty model uses only an intercept: `Hi3Score ~ 1`.
:::

---

### Question 5 (Observed vs Predicted)
Residuals are computed as:

- [x] Observed − Predicted  
- [ ] Predicted − Observed  
- [ ] Observed + Predicted  
- [ ] Observed ÷ Predicted  

:::{.solution}
Residual = observed outcome minus model prediction.
:::

---

### Question 6 (Short answer: compute a residual)
Suppose the mean `Hi3Score` is 17.0 (so the empty model predicts 17.0 for everyone).  
If one student has `Hi3Score = 25`, what is that student’s residual?

```{short-answer}
8
````

:::{.solution}
Residual = 25 − 17 = 8.
:::

---

### Question 7 (resid() meaning)

If you fit `m <- lm(Hi3Score ~ 1, data = flappyBird)`, which command returns the residuals?

* [ ] `coef(m)`
* [ ] `predict(m)`
* [x] `resid(m)`
* [ ] `summary(m)`

:::{.solution}
`resid(m)` returns the vector of residuals for the model.
:::

---

### Question 8 (Properties of residuals in the empty model)

Which statements are true for residuals from an empty model fit with least squares?
(Select all that apply.)

* [x] The sum of residuals is (approximately) 0
* [x] The mean of the residuals is (approximately) 0
* [ ] Every residual is 0
* [ ] Residuals must be all positive

:::{.solution}
With an intercept-only least squares model, residuals sum to 0 and have mean 0, but they vary above/below 0.
:::

---

### Question 9 (Comparing histograms)

Which statement best describes the relationship between the histogram of `Hi3Score` and the histogram of residuals from the empty model?

* [x] They have the same shape, but residuals are centered around 0
* [ ] They are identical and centered around the mean
* [ ] Residuals are always positive, so the shapes differ completely
* [ ] Residuals are always between 0 and 1

:::{.solution}
Residuals are just `Hi3Score` shifted by subtracting the mean, so the shape is the same, but centered at 0.
:::

---

### Question 10 (When the empty model is not enough)

If a scatterplot shows a clear positive relationship between `Hi3Score` and `HiEndScore`, what does that imply?

* [ ] The empty model is the best possible model
* [x] A model using `HiEndScore` could predict `Hi3Score` better than the empty model
* [ ] `HiEndScore` must be categorical
* [ ] Residuals should be ignored

:::{.solution}
If `HiEndScore` helps explain variation in `Hi3Score`, then adding it as an explanatory variable can improve predictions.

## Optional tweak to make Q6 “truly auto-graded” using *their* computed mean
If you prefer not to hard-code 17.0, I can rewrite Q6 so the notebook computes the mean and the quiz uses that value (still auto-graded) — but it depends on your exact Quarto quiz engine/setup.

---

If you tell me what you’re rendering this lab as (**Quarto HTML**, **Quarto revealjs**, or **pure Jupyter**), I can format these questions in the *exact* syntax that your setup will auto-grade reliably.

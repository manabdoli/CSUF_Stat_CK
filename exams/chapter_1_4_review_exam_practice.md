# CourseKata Chapters 1–4 Review Exam (Practice)

**Instructions:** This is a review exam to help you prepare for the Chapter 1–4 test. Work without notes if possible. Calculators are allowed unless stated otherwise. Show reasoning for full credit on open‑ended questions.

## Part A: Core Concepts (Short Answer)

1. Explain the difference between **a variable** and **a value**. Give one example of each.

2. What is the difference between **categorical** and **quantitative** variables? Give one example of each.

3. What does it mean for data to show **variation**, and why is variation central to statistics?

4. Explain the difference between a **population** and a **sample**.

5. What is meant by the **Data Generating Process (DGP)**?

## Part B: Data Structures and Description

6. What does it mean for data to be **tidy**?

7. In a data frame, what do rows represent? What do columns represent?

8. Explain the difference between a **distribution** and a **single data value**.

---

## Part C: Visualizations

9. Which plot is most appropriate in each situation? Briefly justify your choice.
   a. A quantitative response and a categorical explanatory variable
   b. A quantitative response and a quantitative explanatory variable
   c. A categorical response and a categorical explanatory variable

10. What information does a **histogram** show that a table of values does not?

11. What does changing the **binwidth** in a histogram affect?

---

## Part D: Numerical Summaries

12. List the five numbers in the **five‑number summary**.

13. What does the **IQR** measure, and how is it calculated?

14. What does the **median** represent in a distribution?

---

## Part E: Boxplots and Outliers

15. What information is displayed in a **boxplot**?

16. State the **1.5 × IQR rule** for identifying outliers.

---

## Part F: Modeling Relationships

17. What is a **response variable**? Why must it be identified before choosing a plot?

18. When the response variable is **numerical**, what quantity does an informal model typically predict?

19. When the response variable is **categorical**, what quantity does an informal model typically predict?

20. What is a **residual**, and what does it tell us about a model?

---

## Part G: Practice Scenarios

21. A researcher compares test scores between two teaching methods.
   a. Identify the response and explanatory variables.
   b. What plot would you use?

22. A study examines whether the proportion of students who pass an exam differs by tutoring status.
   a. Identify the response and explanatory variables.
   b. What should be compared: counts or proportions? Why?

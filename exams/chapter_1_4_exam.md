## Part D: Modeling with a Numerical Response

13. In a study of study time and exam score:
   a. Identify the response variable.
   b. Identify the explanatory variable.
   c. What plot would you use to visualize this relationship?

14. What does a **residual** measure? How does it help us evaluate a model?

## Part E: Modeling with a Categorical Response

15. A study examines whether the proportion of students who pass an exam differs by tutoring status.
   a. Identify the response variable.
   b. Identify the explanatory variable.
   c. Should the comparison focus on counts or proportions? Explain.

16. What is a **conditional proportion**, and why is it important?

## Part F: Concept Integration (6 points)

17. In one well‑organized paragraph, explain how we move from raw data to a model, referencing ideas from Chapters 1–4 (variables, distributions, visualization, and modeling).
